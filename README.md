**This is my attempt at a really bare-bones engine to make games.**
*(This is more like a helpful library to make life easier)*

This 'engine' implements [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) to take care om input and screen output.

*NOTE: If you wish to build a project you should take a look at [the raylib wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/) under the 'Development Platforms' tab.*
